# # Orchestration and Monitoring Module

This module is responsible for managing the data pipeline, monitoring its performance, and alerting in case of failures or anomalies. It includes the following tasks:

## Workflow Orchestration

The module will implement a workflow orchestration system to manage the data pipeline. This could be one of the following:

- **Apache Airflow**: An open-source platform for orchestrating complex workflows. It allows us to define Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to manage our data pipeline.
- **AWS Step Functions**: An AWS service for building serverless workflows using state machines.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Microsoft's cloud-based data integration service for orchestrating and automating data movement and transformation.

## Monitoring and Logging

The module will integrate with monitoring and logging tools for pipeline monitoring and troubleshooting. This could include:

- **Prometheus**: A monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics from various services.
- **Grafana**: A tool to visualize and analyze metrics from Prometheus or other data sources.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: A suite of tools for centralized logging and log analysis.

## Alerting and Notification

The module will implement alerting and notification mechanisms for pipeline failures or anomalies. This could involve setting up alerts using tools like PagerDuty, Slack, or email notifications.
# # Step 1: Set up Azure Data Factory for Workflow Orchestration
# You would need to create a data factory on Azure portal and then create pipelines, datasets, and activities.

# Step 2: Set up Prometheus for Monitoring
# Install Prometheus in your environment, configure it to scrape metrics from your services, and start the Prometheus server.

# Step 3: Set up Grafana for Visualization
# Install Grafana, connect it to your Prometheus server as a data source, and create dashboards to visualize the metrics.

# Step 4: Set up ELK Stack for Logging
# Install and configure Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Set up Logstash to collect and process logs, store them in Elasticsearch, and use Kibana to visualize the data.

# Step 5: Set up Alerting
# Configure alert rules in Prometheus and set up alert notifications via email, Slack, or other methods.
