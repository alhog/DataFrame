# **Orchestration and Monitoring Module - Technical Guide**

The Orchestration and Monitoring Module is responsible for orchestrating the execution of the data pipeline and monitoring its performance.

### **Step 1: Workflow Orchestration with Apache Airflow**

Set up Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def data_ingestion():
    # Data ingestion code

def data_cleaning():
    # Data cleaning code

with DAG('data_pipeline', start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval=None) as dag:
    ingest = PythonOperator(task_id='data_ingestion', python_callable=data_ingestion)
    clean = PythonOperator(task_id='data_cleaning', python_callable=data_cleaning)

    ingest >> clean
```

### **Step 2: Monitoring and Logging with Prometheus and ELK Stack**

Set up Prometheus for monitoring and ELK Stack for logging.

```python
# Prometheus configuration
job_name: 'data_pipeline'
metrics_path: '/metrics'
static_configs:
  - targets: ['localhost:8000']

# ELK Stack
import logging
import logstash

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.addHandler(logstash.LogstashHandler('localhost', 5044))
```

### **Step 3: Alerting and Notification**

Set up alerts and notifications for pipeline failures or anomalies.

```python
import smtplib

def send_email_alert(subject, message):
    sender = 'your_email@example.com'
    receivers = ['recipient@example.com']

    body = f'Subject: {subject}\n\n{message}'

    with smtplib.SMTP('localhost') as smtp:
        smtp.sendmail(sender, receivers, body)
```



This guide covers the essential steps for implementing the Data Storage and Retrieval, Orchestration and Monitoring, and Testing and Quality Assurance modules using popular tools and libraries. Remember to adapt and customize these steps based on your specific requirements and technology stack.
